My Predictions were correct\\n- iPhone SE \u2705\\n- iPhone 13 (Green Colour) \u2705 (& Alpine Green)\\n- iPad Air (Colours and 5G) \u2705\\n- Mystery Mac??? \u2705 (Mac Studio)\\n- Service Updates \u2705 (Apple TV+)\\n\\n\\n## 2. The Mac Studio\\nThe Mac Studio is a taller version of the Mac Mini...\\n\\n<img src=\\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/images/product/mac/standard/Apple-Mac-Studio-Studio-Display-hero-220308_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg\\" class=\\"blogimg\\" />\\n\\n\\nI believe the Mac Studio will be great for people who need a halfway between the Mac Mini and Mac Pro as it has the most powerful chip in Apple\'s lineup called the M1 Ultra which is M1 Max\'s put together with a feature they hid from the chip.\\n\\nThey also claim that the studio is faster than the Mac Pro. Which leads me to believe the new and upcoming Mac Pro must have 2 **or more** of the Ultra chips?\\n\\n## 3. The Studio Display\\n\\n\\n<img src=\\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/images/product/mac/standard/Apple-Studio-Display-Magic-Trackpad-Keyboard-Mouse-220308_big.jpg.large_2x.jpg\\" class=\\"blogimg\\" />\\n\\nThe Studio Display in my opinion is stunning...\\n\\n- It has a built in webcam\\n- Hey Siri built in\\n- Spatial Audio Speakers\\n\\n**What more could you want from a display?**\\n\\n## 4. Where can I get it?\\nYou can go to **apple.com** or to an **Apple Store or anywhere that sells Apple products**"},{"id":"applespringevt","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/applespringevt","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-07-apple-spring-event.md","title":"What I expect from the Spring Apple Event","description":"I expect Apple to announce multiple products tommorow:","date":"2022-03-07T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"March 7, 2022","tags":[{"label":"apple","permalink":"/blog/tags/apple"}],"readingTime":0.415,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Reece Atkinson","title":"Frontend Developer","url":"https://github.com/reeceatkinson","imageURL":"https://github.com/reeceatkinson.png","key":"reece"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"applespringevt","title":"What I expect from the Spring Apple Event","authors":["reece"],"tags":["apple"]},"prevItem":{"title":"My thoughts on the Mac Studio and Studio Display","permalink":"/blog/macstudio"},"nextItem":{"title":"Introducing Electric Purple","permalink":"/blog/theme"}},"content":"## I expect Apple to announce multiple products tommorow:\\n- iPhone SE\\n- iPhone 13 (Green Colour)\\n- iPad Air (Colours and 5G)\\n- Mystery Mac???\\n- Service Updates\\n\\nIf there is anymore I would be very surprised!\\n\\n\\n## Why do I think there is a mystery Mac?\\nThe fact that the event is called **Peek Performance** I believe that they want to **peek** into the future of the Mac with their Apple Silcons which would refer to the **performace** point of view."},{"id":"theme","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/theme","source":"@site/blog/2022-02-20-theme.md","title":"Introducing Electric Purple","description":"Introducing Electric Purple...","date":"2022-02-20T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 20, 2022","tags":[{"label":"developer","permalink":"/blog/tags/developer"},{"label":"vscode","permalink":"/blog/tags/vscode"},{"label":"theme","permalink":"/blog/tags/theme"}],"readingTime":0.71,"truncated":false,"authors":[{"name":"Reece Atkinson","title":"Frontend Developer","url":"https://github.com/reeceatkinson","imageURL":"https://github.com/reeceatkinson.png","key":"reece"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"theme","title":"Introducing Electric Purple","authors":["reece"],"tags":["developer","vscode","theme"]},"prevItem":{"title":"What I expect from the Spring Apple Event","permalink":"/blog/applespringevt"},"nextItem":{"title":"What I use in my day to day!","permalink":"/blog/everyday"}},"content":"## Introducing Electric Purple...\\nElectric purple is a theme that relieves and prevents eye strain by maintaining dark mode but also adding a pop of colour to developers workspaces.\\n\\n## Hitting 100 installs...\\nElectric Purple is coming to 100 installs rapidly and I cannot wait to see how developers feel about it.\\n\\n## What\'s Next?\\nBy Dec 2022 I will be publishing a new theme (which is my favourite colour) Electric Blue.
