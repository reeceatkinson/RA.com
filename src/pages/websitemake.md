# <span style={{color: '#2D50E9'}}>Why you need a website...</span>
1. Depending on the website type **you can make money** by selling something or add adverts to the website like a blog
2. Can help you in the future and will **make you stand out**
3. Websites can be designed to **be anything you want** them to be (e.g. I made my own meeting platform to meet with others)
4. A personal website gives you the **freedom to be creative**
5. **A website can help people**

But **don't let that list limit you...** If you can think it, it should be able to be made!


# <span style={{color: '#2D50E9'}}>Want a website?</span>
I make websites for **anyone who wants one. Prices are flexible** and I should be able to meet your budget as hosting is free* and all I charge is work hours.
