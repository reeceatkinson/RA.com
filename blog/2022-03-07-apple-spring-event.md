## I expect Apple to announce multiple products tommorow:
- iPhone SE
- iPhone 13 (Green Colour)
- iPad Air (Colours and 5G)
- Mystery Mac???
- Service Updates

If there is anymore I would be very surprised!


## Why do I think there is a mystery Mac?
The fact that the event is called **Peek Performance** I believe that they want to **peek** into the future of the Mac with their Apple Silcons which would refer to the **performace** point of view.
