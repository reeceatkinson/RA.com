- iPad Air (Colours and 5G) ✅
- Mystery Mac??? ✅ (Mac Studio)

## 2. The Mac Studio
The Mac Studio is a taller version of the Mac Mini...

I believe the Mac Studio will be great for people who need a halfway between the Mac Mini and Mac Pro as it has the most powerful chip in Apple's lineup called the M1 Ultra which is M1 Max's put together with a feature they hid from the chip.

They also claim that the studio is faster than the Mac Pro. Which leads me to believe the new and upcoming Mac Pro must have 2 **or more** of the Ultra chips?

## 3. The Studio Display

The Studio Display in my opinion is stunning...

- It has a built in webcam
- Hey Siri built in
- Spatial Audio Speakers

**What more could you want from a display?**

## 4. Where can I get it?
You can go to **apple.com** or to an **Apple Store or anywhere that sells Apple products**
